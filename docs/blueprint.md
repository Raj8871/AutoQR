**Enhanced Prompt for Building a Stylish Link-to-URL Website:**

Create a visually appealing and responsive website with the following features:

### **1. Header Section:**
   - **Logo**: Place a logo at the top-left corner of the page. The logo should be simple yet unique, representing the website’s identity.
   - **Navigation Menu**: Include a clean navigation menu with links to "Home," "About," and "Contact." The menu should be placed next to the logo and be easily accessible across all devices.
   - **Sticky Header**: Implement a sticky header, so it remains visible as the user scrolls down the page.
   - **Font and Color**: Use modern typography (e.g., bold sans-serif) and a contrast-rich color scheme (e.g., dark background with light-colored text). Make sure the header stands out but doesn't overwhelm the rest of the page.

### **2. Main Content Section:**
   - **Prominent Call-to-Action Button**: Create a large, centered button with the text “Click Here to Visit” (or something more personalized). 
     - The button should be attractive, with rounded corners and a smooth hover effect that changes the button's color, size, or shadow.
     - When clicked, the button should open a specified URL in a **new tab** (`target="_blank"`) to ensure users can easily return to the original site.
   - **Background Design**: Use a visually engaging background—either a gradient, a soft abstract image, or a solid color that complements the overall website theme. Ensure the background is subtle so it doesn’t distract from the main button.

### **3. Footer Section:**
   - **Social Media Icons**: Include minimalist icons (e.g., Instagram, Twitter, Facebook) that link to your social profiles. The icons should be clean and match the design aesthetic of the site.
   - **Copyright Notice**: Display a simple copyright notice at the bottom of the footer: “© 2025 Your Website Name. All Rights Reserved.”
   - **Link to Privacy Policy & Terms**: Add discreet links to the privacy policy and terms of service (if applicable).

### **4. Design Considerations:**
   - **Responsive Layout**: Ensure the website is fully responsive, providing a seamless experience whether the user is on a mobile device, tablet, or desktop.
   - **Animations**: Add subtle animations to elements like the header when scrolling or the button when hovered to make the website more interactive and engaging.
     - For example, when the user hovers over the button, it should grow slightly and change color, creating a fluid transition.
   - **Accessibility**: Ensure all elements, such as buttons and links, are accessible to users with disabilities (e.g., proper contrast, clear font size, and alt text for images).
   
### **5. Additional Features:**
   - **Loading Screen (Optional)**: Add a brief, attractive loading screen when the page first loads, showing your logo or a creative animation.
   - **SEO & Meta Tags**: Optimize the site’s meta tags for better search engine ranking. Include a clear title, description, and relevant keywords for the URL you are linking to.
   - **Favicon**: Add a unique favicon (the little icon in the browser tab) that matches your website’s logo or theme.
